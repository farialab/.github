## *ADS++* (Acute-stroke Detection Segmentation)
### About
**ADS++** , is an open-source PyTorch-based toolbox that directly addresses these challenges by offering a modular, clinically-oriented, and highly interoperable suite of tools specifically designed for multimodal stroke imaging. Building upon our established Acute-stroke Detection Segmentation (ADS) framework, ADS++ provides a streamlined environment that encourages both the use of a complete, validated workflow and the flexible integration of its individual components with external tools and pipelines. The core philosophy of ADS++ is to deconstruct the monolithic toolkit into powerful, independently useful modules, each excelling at its specific task while maintaining seamless connectivity within the ADS++ workflow and with the broader neuroimaging ecosystem.

**ADS++ allows you to:**

*   **Effortlessly manage and standardize diverse multimodal stroke datasets** (DICOM, NIfTI, BIDS, remote S3/HTTP sources) through its adaptive **Ads-IO** module, eliminating cumbersome format conversions.
*   **Implement robust and reproducible preprocessing pipelines** using **Ads-Prep**, incorporating tools like SynthStrip, ANTs, and TorchIO for tasks like skull stripping, registration, and normalization, with built-in quality control.
*   **Utilize and develop state-of-the-art deep learning models** for stroke lesion segmentation (e.g., our flagship **DAGMNet**) and other tasks within **Ads-DL**, with support for a model zoo (UNet, MONAI integration) and flexible training powered by PyTorch Lightning.
*   **Generate clinically relevant quantitative analyses and automated reports** through **AdsReport**, including volumetric analysis, territorial mapping, and integration of explainable AI techniques for better model understanding.
*   **Quantify stroke characteristics and predict outcomes** using machine learning models within **Ads-ML**, with tools like auto-sklearn to optimize model selection.
*   **Easily deploy validated models** to various environments, including Docker containers for reproducibility and optimized models for edge devices with **Ads-Deploy**.
*   **Develop new, specialized modules or integrate existing external tools** more rapidly by leveraging the clear interfaces and standardized data structures within ADS++.
